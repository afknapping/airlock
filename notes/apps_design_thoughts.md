So, there are multiple things I want to facilitate in all:
$LIST


But for now, what I need to do to finish up this dev cycle is:
$LIST

Then, I can make the guide which will replicate a very basic
4chan-style imageboard.


Start with use case: You want to use urbit, you want to create an imageboard application.

How do you do it? Well, social media primitive offered by urbit is the graph. 
Specifically, the %graph-store.

In this guide, we'll start by creating a schema for the imageboard,
and a rough idea of how the frontend should work. 

Then, we'll work on the small amount of server-side code (in hoon) we need (if any).

Then, we'll create a basic client and visualizer.
