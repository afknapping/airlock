# TODO
- move towards stable master
- up to date examples once everything stabilizes
- upload junit report test.html as github actions artifact

# Current Focus
- initial scry / spider tests
- chat store / chat view interfaces



# Ideas
- possibly make custom exceptions that wrap around known failure modes
    - for example: ShipNotAvailable when first http request fails ...
